**To-Do List Application:**
This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks. The task data is stored in the browser's local storage so that the tasks persist even after a page refresh.

**Features:**
Add Tasks: You can add a new task to the list.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Click on a task to toggle its completion status.
Delete Tasks: Remove a task from the list by clicking the trash bin icon.
Data Persistence: Tasks are stored in local storage, so they persist even after a page refresh.

**Technologies Used:**
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS: For basic styling of the application.
FontAwesome: For the trash bin icon used to delete tasks.
